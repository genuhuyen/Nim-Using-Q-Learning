# Nim-Using-Q-Learning

This program runs a simple Nim game between a user and computer.
Before the game starts: it runs a specified number of game simulations to generate a map with the best possible moves for each state of the board. 
The computer will then use this Q-table generated to make the optimal move when playing with the user.

Users can specified the starting pile number of sticks as well as how many game simulations to run Q-learning on (the higher # of simulation,  the more accurate Q-learning will be)
