# Nim-Using-Q-Learning

This program is a simple Nim game. It uses Q-Learning to generate a map with the best possible moves for each state of the board. 
The computer uses this Q-table generated to make the optimal move. 

Users can specified the starting pile number of sticks as well as how many game simulations to run Q-learning on (the higher # of simulation,  the more accurate Q-learning will be)
